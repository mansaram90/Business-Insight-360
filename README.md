### Project Overview

**Business Insights 360** is an end-to-end **Power BI analytics project** built as a capstone after completing the *Get Job Ready: Power BI Data Analytics for All Levels 3.0* course by Codebasics.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how **five years of company data** can be transformed into **actionable business insights** across multiple business units using Power BI.

The dashboard is designed for **executive and senior management audiences**, focusing on clarity, storytelling, and decision support rather than technical complexity.
